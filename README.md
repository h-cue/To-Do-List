## A to-do-list, using CSS?
Todays task is making a functional and interactive (except adding/removing items) To-Do-List, using only CSS.

A wise man (Jakob) once said:
```If you need to learn a new language, make a to-do-list.```

We have provided you with the HTML file and you are supposed to be able to:

* Click items to mark them as done
* Click again to revert to pending
* Display counters next to the headings with the number of done and pending items respectively
* Make done items appear under the "Done" heading and pending under "Pending"

We want you to:
* Use modular CSS
* Use a sensible naming convention for CSS classes
* Make sure it works the same way in both Firefox and Chrome (latest versions)

You are allowed to:
* Use SASS if you like (otherwise just write pure CSS in the `.scss`-file)
* Any CSS properties you like
* Add/rename/remove CSS classes and ID's
* Add/rephrase/remove text content and list items

_You are not allowed to:_
* Change the HTML structure
* Use JavaScript

The package comes bundled with an autorefreshing `webpack-dev-server`, which bundles your SASS in real time.

Happy hacking!
